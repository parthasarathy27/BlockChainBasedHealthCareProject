# Patient-Controlled EHRs Sharing with Blockchain

This repository contains the source code for a patient-controlled Electronic Health Records (EHRs) sharing system, developed using ASP.Net and integrating blockchain technology for secure and tamper-proof storage. The project implements fine-grained access control, encryption schemes, and a node-state-checkable Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (sc-PBFT) consensus algorithm to ensure the integrity and reliability of medical data sharing.

## Features

- **Patient Registration:** Patients can register and create their accounts securely.
- **EHRs Sharing:** Patients have full control over the sharing of their Electronic Health Records with medical institutions.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Access to EHRs is controlled based on attributes and keywords, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes blockchain technology for tamper-proof storage and integrity verification of medical data.
- **Node-State-Checkable PBFT Consensus:** Implements a consensus algorithm to maintain network reliability and resiliency against malicious nodes.

## Software Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Technology Used:** ASP.Net
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Web Server:** IIS (Internet Information Service)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio

## Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parthasarathy27/BlockChainBasedHealthCareProject
```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Set up SQL Server and configure the database as per the provided schema.

4. Build and run the project using IIS.

5. Access the system via a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Patient Registration:** Patients can register and create their accounts securely.

2. **EHRs Sharing:** Patients have the option to share their Electronic Health Records with designated medical institutions securely.

3. **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Access to EHRs is controlled based on attributes and keywords, ensuring privacy and security.

4. **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes blockchain technology for tamper-proof storage and integrity verification of medical data.

5. **Node-State-Checkable PBFT Consensus:** Implements a consensus algorithm to maintain network reliability and resiliency against malicious nodes.
