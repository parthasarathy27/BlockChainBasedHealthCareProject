# Patient-Controlled EHRs Sharing with Blockchain

## Description

This project proposes a patient-controlled Electronic Health Records (EHRs) sharing scheme, leveraging cloud computing and blockchain technology. With fine-grained access control, encrypted EHRs are securely stored and accessed. Our node-state-checkable Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm ensures robustness against malicious nodes, enhancing the reliability of medical data sharing.

## Software Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Technology Used:** ASP.Net
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Web Server:** IIS (Internet Information Service)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio

## Deployment

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Set up SQL Server and configure the database.
4. Run the project using IIS.
5. Access the system via a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Patient Registration:** Patients can register and create their accounts.
2. **EHRs Sharing:** Patients can control the sharing of their Electronic Health Records with medical institutions.
3. **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Access to EHRs is controlled based on attributes and keywords, ensuring privacy and security.
4. **Blockchain Integration:** Blockchain technology ensures tamper-proof storage and integrity of medical data.
5. **Node-State-Checkable PBFT Consensus:** The consensus algorithm maintains network reliability and resiliency against malicious nodes.
